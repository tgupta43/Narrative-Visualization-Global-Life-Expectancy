Extremely grateful to my team at [Netflix](https://twitter.com/netflixdata) for mentoring me, giving me feedback, and helping out on this project. Cheers [Elijah](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks), [James](https://twitter.com/james_womack), [Jason](https://twitter.com/onemerovingian), and [Nathan](https://twitter.com/nathantowery).

Invaluable help from [Fil](https://twitter.com/recifs), thanks for jumping in early to help with testing and discussion.

[Sam](https://twitter.com/samccone) keeps me sane and gets all the perf wins \o/

This is a data visualization project that wouldn't be possible without [Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock)'s work on [d3](https://d3js.org/), and all of the inspiring [prior art](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation#prior-art) in annotations, particularly [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce)'s [Swoopy Drag](https://1wheel.github.io/swoopy-drag/), and [Andrew Mollica](https://twitter.com/armollica)'s [Ring Note](https://github.com/armollica/d3-ring-note). 

Thumbs up to [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee) via Google Fonts and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for making the docs site building a breeze.
