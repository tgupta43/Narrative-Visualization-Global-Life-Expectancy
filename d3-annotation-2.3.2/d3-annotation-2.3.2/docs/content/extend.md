<h2><a href="#extend">#</a>Extending Annotation Types</h2>


The underlying code for d3-annotation has a base annotation type that all of the annotation types extend. The settings and components that make up the different types are customizable. 

The goal was to make a system that was easy to add new types and implement layout algorithms with. A longer post with details about how you can make your own type will be coming out soon. 

If you're interested in looking at the architecture before the post you can find the [source code here](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/tree/master/src).
