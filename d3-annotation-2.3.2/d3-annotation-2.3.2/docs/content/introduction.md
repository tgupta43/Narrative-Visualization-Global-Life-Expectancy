Annotations **establish context, and direct our users to insights and anomalies**. So why are annotations so few and far between in visualizations on the web? Because **implementing them is difficult.**

**But it shouldn't be.** 

Use d3-annotation with built-in annotation types, or extend it to make custom annotations. It is made for [d3-v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) in SVG.
