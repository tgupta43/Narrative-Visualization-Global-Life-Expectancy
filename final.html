        <div id="title">Global Life Expectancy, Child Mortality, GDP</div>
        <div id="subtitle">We are all humans with the same basic biology. Despite this, Scene 1 showed us that different countries/continents have different average life expectancies. North America and Europe have most "first world countries" as they say, so this can be a reason.<br> Upon looking deeper into another factor that can affect life expectancy, Scene 2 showed us that child mortality also has a hand in affecting life expectancies. But that makes us wonder, why do some countries have higher mortality rates? <br> Looking at Scene 3 answers this. Higher GDP reflects higher Life Expectancies. In other words, the more "wealthy" the countries economy, the better health and life. <br> However, this is not great news. All humans have the right to a healthy life, and unfortunately if their countries economy is not the best, their life spans may be shorter. It is almost as if governments and politics have influence over the health of a person. This should make us rethink a lot of how we do things today. </div>
